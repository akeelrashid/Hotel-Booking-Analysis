# Hotel-Booking-Analysis
A Real world dataset of hotel bookings has been given from 2015 to 2017.We have to analyze the whole dataset. The dataset contains booking information of city hotel and resort hotel. The whole problem can be done by clean the data and after that analying and manupulating the data and at last doing some visvalization. first of all i imported all the labraries with specific alias in the google colab and then i mounted my google drive with colab notebook and imported the downloaded hotel booking csv file and used it as a dataframe using pandas library.. Data analysis and data visualization will be performed by using different python labraries like numpy,pandas,matplotlib and seaborn.
The dataset contains 119390 rows and 32 columns with object,int,float datatype.The dataset also contains 31944 duplicate rows.so have to drop these values and after analyzing each column it has been find out that company,agent,children,reserved_room_type contains null value.Company and agent columns contains maximum null value.so we wil drop these two columns and we will replace null values in country and children column with mode and mean values.After that analyzing each variable by describe and unique methods.After that doing some Data wrangling and removing outliers from lead_time,adr,days_in_waiting_list columns as these columns contains more outliers.After that doing some data manupulation like adding 'total_stay' column using 'stays_in_weekend_nights' & 'stays_in_week_nights' columns and 'total_guest' column using 'aduts','children' and 'babies' columns
After that do the visualiztion and understand the relationships between the variables by following Univariate,Bivariate and Multivariate analysis by using bar,count,pie etc charts
Atlast find out the correlation of different variables with each using heatma
